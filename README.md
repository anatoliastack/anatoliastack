# Anadolu Stack

**Anatolia Stack** is a production-ready Go web boilerplate created and maintained by  
**Serhan KARAKOÇ**.

It represents a **server-driven, form-based, real-world web architecture** built with Go.

No SPA.  
No frontend frameworks.  
Just clean, fast and maintainable web applications.
